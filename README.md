### The Tree of Charts
---

On the one hand the tree of charts is a simple visual search engine for different chart types. It has 88 charts dangling of its branches and you can pick them by just searching or browsing the tree. On the other hand it accompanies and focuses the thought-process when moving from raw data to a visual. Often it's great to play around with data and different visuals in your tool of choice, but apart from being a time-save having a solid desgin process in place allows us to build an efficient mental model of visual options. Once we have followed some guidelines and understand the connection between data and their forms better, it's easier and clearly more fun to break the rules where necessary.

The framework applied orders the chart finding process along 3 lines:

1. What data have we got ? 
2. Why are we producing a visual ?
3. How are we designing it ?

Admittedly the tree has a lot more flexibility and doesn't force anyone to think along this straight line, but these 3 questions are recurring in the descriptions and the tree structure (it's soft education)...

#### Standing on the shoulder of Tamara Munzner

The framework (partly surely amateurlike) applied has been developped by [Tamara Munzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_Munzner) in her 2014 book [Visualization Analysis and Design](https://www.crcpress.com/Visualization-Analysis-and-Design/Munzner/9781466508910) and leads the interested person through above pipeline of questions to arrive at the right visual idiom (in her case often large-scale visualization systems - in this case relatively standard charts). The above 3 steps are only a brief summary not encapsulating the more elaborate process she describes but for my small brain and this chart- rather than system-focussed project - they suffice.


#### How to use

###### Search

Have some data and a vague idea of what you want to show. Search for:

* Chart name

* Data type (Munzner categories)
	* Tables
	* Spatial data
	* Network
	* Tree

* Data type (Schneiderman categories)
	* 1D/Linear
	* 2D/Planar
	* 3D/Volumetric
	* nD/Multidimensional
	* Tree/Hierarchical
	* Network
	* Temporal

* Number of variables in your (long) dataset
	* 1 variable
	* 2 variables
	* 3 variables
	* 4 or more variables

* Number of categories (maximum numbber of categories if you have a categorical key variable)
	* under 10 categories
	* 10-99 categories
	* 100-999 categories
	* 1000 and more categories

* Number of values (maximum number of datapoints the visual can/should display)
	* under 20 values
	* Dozens of values
	* Hundreds of values
	* Thousands of values
	* Infinite no. of values


###### Chart cards

The chart cards show an image, a quick description to the chart and under *more info* keywords regrading Munzner's visual analysis process, a description on (a possible) table structure, some example variables and historical background where available.


I did not try to re-invent wheels. Although most of the texts are written by myself and a good chunk of visuals are also hand-crafted for the project, a good piece of the material is taken from sources who have already readily described or produced the charts. It's a medley !


###### The tree

Click *browse tree* to find your visual in the tree. Once in there you can browse the tree and see what other charts might tickle your pickle.

The tree is also shape-shifting. It can change hierarchy depending on what conecptual journey you opt for to find your chart. You can for example start thinking about your data type, then how many variables you have and finally how many points you want to display. To do so, hit **what data** (a short description of the hierarchy is shown underneath the buttons). Or you might come from less techincal and more conceptual ground thinking about why you want to build a chart (what is your main interest ? what is the aim of the visual analysis ?). There's a tree for that via the **why** button. Best to play around
